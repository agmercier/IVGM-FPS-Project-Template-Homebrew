  - "\rHey, you. You\u2019re finally awake. "
  - 'You were knocked out pretty good for quite a while there...

'
  - 'I hope that you''re at least a bit recovered by now though.

    Ye''re gonna
    need yer strength.'
  - It seems there has been a malfunction in their system so you might be able to
    get out of here, kid.
  - "I am not sure what has become of the outside world after the robots took over,
    but it must be better than in here, right?\r"
  - "Take my advice and grab this chance while you can. \n"
  - "I won't be able to follow, but at least this way one of us will get to see the
    sky, Huh.\r"
  - Well, no matter. If you want to get outta here you will need to get those legs
    back in working order.
  - If you decomission enough bots, it might make the system malfunction further
    and you can run on up to the next floor.
  - Remember, to make your escape press the W,A,S,D keys to move and hold SHIFT to
    run.
  - And if you come across any obstacles you can jump by pressing SPACEBAR or crouch
    behind it by pressing C.
  - Lastly, if you manage to get yer hands on a gun. Make sure to give those bots
    hell by pressing the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON to shoot.
  - You can also zoom in by pressing the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.
  - 'Good luck kid!

    Just make sure to steer clear of the light.'
